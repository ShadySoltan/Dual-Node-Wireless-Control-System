# Dual-Node Wireless Control System
 This project involves the development of a dual-node wireless control system utilizing a Tiva C microcontroller as the master node and an AVR ATmega32 microcontroller as the slave node. The system is designed to receive commands via Bluetooth through an HC-05 module, interfaced with the Tiva C via UART.  The master node processes the received data and communicates with the slave node using the SPI protocol. The project demonstrates the control of various peripherals, including a servo motor for door operations, LEDs, and a DC motor. The servo motor, connected to the master node, executes open and close commands, while the slave node, controlled by the AVR kit, manages LED indicators and the DC motor.  This project showcases the integration of wireless communication, multi-node coordination, and real-time control within an embedded systems environment.
